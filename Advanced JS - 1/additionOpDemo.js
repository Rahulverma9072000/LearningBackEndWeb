let obj = {};

console.log("18" + obj); 
//First both of them go Primitive Operation 
// "18" -> "18"; and obj will return "[Object Object]"
//Answer will be 18[object Object]
console.log(18+obj);
//18 "[object Object]
//Anyone of them is String then it convert both of them to String 
//and in Answer it concatenate them 
//18[object Object]
